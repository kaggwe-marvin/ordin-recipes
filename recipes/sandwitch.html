    <h2>homemade Sandwitch</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade sandwitch recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade sandwitch filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
